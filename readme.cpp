Project2 Decimal to Binary Conversion

This project is for converting a decimal number into its binary equivalent using a stack for the integer part and a queue for the decimal part.

 The program first asks the user to input a decimal number.
 It then splits the number into two parts, Decimal and Integer. 
 The integer part is converted to binary using a stack.
 The decimal part is converted to binary using a queue.
 The binary representations are printed out.
