Project2 Decimal to Binary Conversion

This project is for converting a decimal number into its binary equivalent using a stack for the integer part and a queue for the decimal part.

1. The program first asks the user to input a decimal number.
2. It then splits the number into two parts
    Decimal part 
    Integer part 
3. The integer part is converted to binary using a stack.
4. The decimal part is converted to binary using a queue.
5. The binary representations are printed out.
